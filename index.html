            MY GOALS FOR THE NEXT 2 YEARS IN TECH
        </h2>
        <p data-testid="article">
            My name is <strong>Collins Ennah,</strong> a frontend developer who is
            passionate about web development, building interactive and responsive
            web applications. I look forward to breaking into the tech industry soon
            with these short term goals of mine in mind.
        </p>

        <ul data-testid="subSection">
            <li>
            Firstly,I want to have secured a full time developer job with a
            reputable organization.
            </li>
            <li>
            Secondly, with my experience in the industry I look forward to
            becoming a team lead in the next 2 years.
            </li>

            <li>
            I will also want to learn a backend framework with the aim of becoming
            a full stack developer.
            </li>

            <li>
            Becoming a mentor to new developers who are looking to break into tech
            which is my way of giving back to the community.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So these are my 2 years / short term goals in my tech journey and I hope
            to accomplish them all through focus, hardwork, consistency &
            discipline.
